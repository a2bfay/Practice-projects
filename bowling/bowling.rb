# Bowling simulator for multiple players with skill-weighted random result on each roll
# [eventual?] Option to score game in progress or after all rolls complete - for now latter disabled
# [eventual] Options at end to repeat games for stats-checking --> partially in use

# 9/26 score-in-progress finished -- multiplayer working, skill working, formatted
# THIS VERS:        testing new skill weighting -- best of n picks
#                   setting up to compare new vs old                              
# 

#   
# existing methods: roll, roll_results(called by roll)
#                   score_progress, update_2prev, update_prev (both called by score_progress)
#                   score_complete, tally_comp(called by score_complete)
# added:            newgame, getplayers, turn_control

# CHANGES FINISHED: array to store player/skill combinations -- check (simple; no nesting required)
#                   player number as argument for methods -- check
#                   way to increment frames/rolls across players -- check
#                   extra nesting/layer to @frame_scores and @game_scores arrays --> with changes to all refs 
#                   in general : @frame_scores[i][0] --> @frame_scores[player][frame][roll] -- check
#                   skill variation -- check
#                   DECIDED ON : arithmetic rather than exponential approach -- gets to pro level w/ much simpler math
# PLUS:             formatted output for mult players --> happens in score_prog ==> w/ components in getplayers and turn_control as well
#                   learned .ljust/.rjust to make work
