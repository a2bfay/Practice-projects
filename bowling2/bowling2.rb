# "The knowledge that rims are at [0] should not be duplicated; it should be known in just one place."

# BOWLING SIMULATOR WITH SCORING DONE FRAME-BY-FRAME (vs. 'kata' version)
# second attempt - trying to design by proper classes/object-orientation
# will write as single-player, then add back multiplayer/skill weights
# but:  first thought -
# the basic units/tasks here might be:
#   roll / select result from input range
#   frame / store some number of rolls, give total/bonus
#     frame-tenth / same, w/ special cases
#   player-turn / create and fill one frame
#   player-game / link ten frames to represent complete game
#   player / (only need if skill or if multiple? not sure)
#   game / directs turns/games and evaluate scores/winners

# crux of trouble so far:  a LANE_GAME is built out of turns, but a PLAYER_GAME is built out of consecutive frames, w/ scores
# should frame data get stored in PLAYER?  that would require TURN to distribute FRAMES among PLAYERS

# ---- MESSAGES ----
# who's playing?
# what frame are we in?
# whose turn is it?
# what roll result/frame result? --> how good is player?
# what's the current score? --> who's the current leader?
# is the game over?
# who won?

# BECAUSE UNIT-TESTING CURRENT VERSION OF FRAME IS TRICKY:
# am I sure sure that roll is a class? because for now roll doesn't 'implement new_roll', it implements *result* -- which isn't really implementing anything
# should it be Lane? or Roller? so that instead of Roll.new.result (where result is just a reader),
# you would inject Roller.new, and expect it to implement roll and roll(pins)?
# except at that point, Roller sounds an awful lot like what you'd call a "frame" in actual bowling --
# its data consists of pins, and its behavior consists of hitting/counting them

# stores a set of rolls in an array
# METZ: "Gear no longer cares about the class of the injected object, it merely expects that it implement diameter."
